Warning (292013): Feature LogicLock is only available with a valid subscription license. You can purchase a software subscription to gain full access to this feature.
Warning (15714): Some pins have incomplete I/O assignments. Refer to the I/O Assignment Warnings report for details
Info (176045): Design uses memory blocks. Violating setup or hold times of memory block address registers for either read or write operations could cause memory contents to be corrupted. Make sure that all memory block address registers meet the setup and hold time requirements.
Info (184020): Starting Fitter periphery placement operations
Info (11191): Automatically promoted 1 clock (1 global)
    Info (11162): FPGA_CLK1_50~inputCLKENA0 with 372 fanout uses global clock CLKCTRL_G6
